# LOS Benchmarking Dashboard

### 🏥 Project Overview: Tableau for Healthcare
*Hospitals use Length of Stay (LOS) benchmarking as a strategic tool to evaluate performance, optimize care delivery, and manage costs.*
- A responsive Tableau-powered dashboard to visualize and benchmark hospital Length of Stay metrics across diagnoses and departments.
---

### 📊 What Is LOS Benchmarking?
Introduce key definitions and methods.
- LOS benchmarking compares a hospital’s average or geometric mean length of stay against standardized expectations.
- These standards often depend on diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), case mix, or national averages.
**Features**
- 📊 KPI visualizations
- 📐 Calculated field logic
- 🏥 Clinical benchmarking by service line
- 💡 Interactive filters and lightbox image expansion

Built with Tableau, HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS — ideal for performance monitoring, care optimization, and professional storytelling.

  ```

### 📁 Required Data Fields
Lay out the data inputs essential for LOS analysis.
- **Admission Date/Time**  
- **Discharge Date/Time**
- **Admission Type** (Planned vs Unplanned/Emergency)  
- **Service/MS-DRGs**  
- **Discharge Disposition** (e.g., Home, Skilled Nursing Facility, Expired)

---

### ⚖️ Key Metrics Used
Provide a concise breakdown of the metrics and their role.
- **ALOS** (Average Length of Stay): Simple mean of patient stays.
- **GMLOS** (Geometric Mean LOS): Reduces skew from outliers.
- **CMA-LOS** (Case-Mix Adjusted LOS): Adjusts for patient complexity.

### 🏨 How Hospitals Use LOS Benchmarks
Show practical implications across hospital operations:
- **Performance Comparison:** Identify outliers vs best practices.
- **Financial Planning:** Align with Medicare's DRG reimbursement structure.
- **Quality Improvement:** Spot delays in discharge or coordination.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Inform staffing and bed utilization decisions.

---

### 🧠 Real-Time Decision Support
Briefly highlight the dashboard’s clinical utility:
> Some hospitals integrate LOS benchmarks into clinical workflows—empowering care teams with real-time visibility into expected LOS based on working DRGs.

---

### ❓ Investigative Questions
Encourage exploration through targeted queries:
- Which diagnoses are contributing most to extended stays?
- Is this a systemic issue or driven by one-off cases?
- Should resources be reallocated for improvement?

---

### 🚀 Why It Matters
Bring the narrative back to the dashboard’s value.
- Monitor trends and exceptions in LOS.
- Benchmark against clinical expectations.
- Identify intervention targets.
- Strengthen discharge and resource planning.
